        <h2>It looks like you are a born Front-end-Developer</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Front-end developers</strong> spend their time making things look and work well, obsessing over layouts, navigation, colors, and design. If this type of work appeals to you, your best bet is to take <strong>CSS/Design</strong> track at Epicodus.

      <div id="ruby">
        <h2>We think your best match is Ruby/Rails</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Ruby</strong> is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though each language has its niche, there is plenty of crossover. For example, Rails' popularity inspired copycats in just about every language, and so you'll see interactive web applications written in C#, Java, and PHP, with Rails-like frameworks including .NET MVC, Spring, and Laravel. Even at one company, you might find them using PHP for their marketing site, Ruby for their web application, and Java for their back-end processing.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="c-net">
        <h2>We think your best match is C#/.NET</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>C#</strong> is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>.NET</strong> is a software framework developed by Microsoft and primarily used on Microsoft Windows. The .NET framework is used to create desktop, mobile, and web applications that run on various devices. It compiles and executes programs written in the C# and Visual Basic languages. C# and .NET are typically used by large enterprises, government agencies, and companies serving enterprises and government clients.
